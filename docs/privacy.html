  <h1>Privacy Policy – Promilli</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 27, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Promilli (“we,” “us,” or “our”) collects, uses, and protects information about you when you use the Promilli mobile application (“the App”). By using Promilli, you agree to the practices described below.</p>
  <p><em>Promilli is an entertainment and social app designed for tracking standard drinks and viewing drinking-related statistics. The App does not serve any medical, diagnostic, or legal purpose.</em></p>

  <h2>1. Definitions</h2>
  <p><strong>App:</strong> The Promilli mobile application.</p>
  <p><strong>User:</strong> Any individual using the App.</p>
  <p><strong>Personal Data:</strong> Any information that can identify you directly or indirectly.</p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We collect only the data necessary to operate the App and provide its features:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account data:</strong> Name, email address, and optional profile image.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> Logged drinks, time of consumption, and statistics used to calculate your personal drink log.</li>
    <li><strong>Profile data:</strong> Public/private status, followers, and blocked users (where applicable).</li>
    <li><strong>Technical data:</strong> Device type, operating system, app version, and IP address (for security and analytics).</li>
    <li><strong>Subscription data:</strong> Information from the App Store or Google Play if you purchase an optional subscription (handled by those platforms).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <p>We use the collected data to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Enable account creation and secure login.</li>
    <li>Allow you to log and view your drink history.</li>
    <li>Support social features such as following, blocking, and searching for profiles.</li>
    <li>Provide personalized statistics and performance insights.</li>
    <li>Deliver and manage advertisements (in the free version).</li>
    <li>Process optional premium subscriptions and manage access to ad-free features.</li>
    <li>Improve app functionality, stability, and security.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell your data. We only share it in the following limited cases:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> With trusted third-party partners who host or process data for us (e.g., Supabase for databases, Cloudflare R2 for image storage). These providers only access data required to perform their tasks.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal obligations:</strong> When required by law, regulation, or court order.</li>
    <li><strong>With your consent:</strong> If you explicitly choose to share or publish content externally.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Data Storage and Deletion</h2>
  <p>All personal data is stored securely and retained only as long as necessary for app functionality or as required by law.</p>
  <p>You can permanently delete your account and associated data at any time via the “Delete Profile” function in the app. Once deleted, your data cannot be restored.</p>

  <h2>6. Security</h2>
  <p>We apply appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data, including encrypted transmission and secure authentication. However, no online service is 100% secure. You use the App at your own risk.</p>

  <h2>7. Audience and Age Restrictions</h2>
  <p>Promilli is intended for users aged 18 and above. We do not knowingly collect or store information from anyone under 18. If such data is discovered, it will be promptly deleted.</p>

  <h2>8. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The App may link to external websites or services (for example, payment or support pages). We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of third-party services. Please review their respective privacy policies before providing any data.</p>

  <h2>9. International Data Transfers</h2>
  <p>Our hosting providers may store and process data in the European Union or other regions with adequate data protection standards. By using the App, you consent to such transfers where necessary to operate the service.</p>

  <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect technical, legal, or business changes. Updates will be posted at <a href="https://promilliapp.github.io/legal/privacy.html">https://promilliapp.github.io/legal/privacy.html</a> (or equivalent). The “Last updated” date at the top will indicate the latest revision.</p>
  <p>Continued use of the App after updates means you accept the revised Privacy Policy.</p>
