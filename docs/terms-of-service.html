  <h1>Terms of Service – Promilli</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 27, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>Welcome to Promilli (“the App”). These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the App, operated by Promilli (“we,” “us,” or “our”). By using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, you must not use the App.</p>

  <h2>2. Eligibility and Accounts</h2>
  <p>You must be at least 18 years old to use Promilli. By creating an account, you confirm that the information you provide is accurate and complete. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and for all activity under your account.</p>
  <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms or applicable laws.</p>

  <h2>3. Nature of the Service</h2>
  <p>Promilli is a <strong>social and entertainment application</strong> that allows users to log drinks, view personal statistics, manage a profile, and connect with other users through features such as following, searching, and blocking. Promilli is intended for <strong>recreational use only</strong>.</p>
  <p>The App does <strong>not</strong> provide medical, legal, or health-related advice. Logged drink data, statistics, and related features are fictionalized representations for social or entertainment purposes. The App must not be used to determine sobriety, driving ability, or physical condition. Use of Promilli for such purposes is entirely at your own risk.</p>

  <h2>4. User Content and Conduct</h2>
  <p>Users may upload profile images, manage their public or private profile, and interact with others. You are responsible for all content you share through the App and for ensuring it does not violate laws or third-party rights.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Do not upload or share illegal, abusive, or discriminatory content.</li>
    <li>Do not impersonate others or misrepresent your identity.</li>
    <li>Do not use Promilli to harass, stalk, or threaten other users.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>By uploading content (such as profile images), you grant Promilli a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to store, process, and display that content as needed to operate the App, in accordance with our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

  <h2>5. Privacy and Data Handling</h2>
  <p>Your privacy is important to us. We collect and process minimal user data necessary for account management and app functionality, as described in our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
  <p>Profile images are securely stored using third-party storage (e.g., Cloudflare R2). Basic usage and log data may be stored in our backend (e.g., Supabase) to enable account features, sync drink logs, and maintain performance.</p>
  <p>You can delete your account at any time through the in-app “Delete Profile” function. Upon deletion, your account data and associated content are permanently removed from our systems, except where retention is legally required.</p>

  <h2>6. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
  <p>Promilli may offer optional subscriptions, such as removing advertisements or unlocking additional features (“Premium”). Subscription terms, pricing, and billing frequency will be clearly displayed before purchase. Payments are processed through Apple App Store or Google Play and subject to their respective terms.</p>
  <p>All purchases are final and non-refundable unless required by applicable law or the app store’s policies.</p>

  <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>All intellectual property rights in the App, including its name, logo, interface design, code, and underlying technology, belong to Promilli. Users may not copy, reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works based on the App without prior written consent.</p>
  <p>Any trademarks or logos displayed in the App remain the property of their respective owners.</p>

  <h2>8. Advertising and Third-Party Content</h2>
  <p>The free version of Promilli may include advertisements. Ads are displayed via third-party networks that operate independently from Promilli. We are not responsible for the content, accuracy, or reliability of third-party advertising or linked websites.</p>
  <p>Choosing a paid subscription will disable ads as described in the subscription details.</p>

  <h2>9. Termination and Account Deletion</h2>
  <p>You may terminate your use of Promilli at any time by deleting your account. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access if you breach these Terms or misuse the App.</p>
  <p>Upon termination, all rights granted to you under these Terms will immediately cease. Account data is deleted as described in our Privacy Policy.</p>

  <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, Promilli and its affiliates shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use or inability to use the App, including but not limited to data loss, reputational harm, or misinterpretation of logged information.</p>
  <p>You acknowledge that Promilli is provided “as is” and “as available,” without any warranties of accuracy, reliability, or fitness for a particular purpose.</p>

  <h2>11. Updates and Changes</h2>
  <p>We may revise these Terms from time to time to reflect changes in our App, business operations, or legal obligations. Updated versions will be posted at <a href="https://promilliapp.github.io/legal/terms.html">https://promilliapp.github.io/legal/terms.html</a> (or equivalent). Your continued use of the App after such updates constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>
